# CoinDrip Protocol

This is the source code of the CoinDrip protocol. CoinDrip is the first token (ESDT) streaming protocol built on MultiversX. Instead of the regular token transfers, you can use CoinDrip to stream tokens each second toward a recipient.

Check out the [docs](https://docs.coindrip.finance) to get a high-level understanding of how CoinDrip works and ways you can integrate it in your project.

## ðŸ›  Usage

If you want to build the smart contract locally, make sure you have [mxpy](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-py/installing-mxpy/) installed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CoinDrip-finance/coindrip-protocol-sc
$ cd coindrip-protocol-sc
$ cargo build
```

If you just want to use the CoinDrip protocol to stream tokens, consider checking out our dApp.

### ABI

If you need the ABI (application binary interface), you can find it in [our docs](https://docs.coindrip.finance/technical-guides/codebase).

### mx js sdk

If you're looking to interact with the CoinDrip protocol using [mx js sdk](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-js-core) you can check out [our examples](https://docs.coindrip.finance/technical-reference) from the docs under "Endpoints" and "Views".
